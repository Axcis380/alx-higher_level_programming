# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Overview

In this project, we will explore one of the fundamental aspects of Python programming: data structures. Specifically, we will dive into two essential data structures - Lists and Tuples.

Python offers a variety of data structures to store and manipulate data efficiently. Lists and Tuples are among the most commonly used ones, and they have distinct characteristics and use cases.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should have a good understanding of:

- How to create and manipulate Lists and Tuples in Python.
- The differences between Lists and Tuples, including their mutability.
- Common operations and methods associated with Lists and Tuples.
- Iterating through these data structures and accessing elements.
- How to use these data structures effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Files

This project includes several Python scripts and text files. Here's an overview of the files you'll find in this repository:

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: A Python script that prints all integers of a list.
- `1-element_at.py`: A Python function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: A Python script that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
- `5-no_c.py`: A Python function that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: A Python script that prints a matrix of integers.
- `7-add_tuple.py`: A Python function that adds two tuples.
- `8-multiple_returns.py`: A Python function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
- `9-max_integer.py`: A Python function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
- `10-divisible_by_2.py`: A Python function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
- `11-delete_at.py`: A Python function that deletes an item at a specific position in a list.
- `12-switch.py`: A Python script that switches the values of two variables.
- `13-is_palindrome.c`: A Python function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

## Getting Started

To run the Python scripts in this project, you'll need a Python interpreter installed on your system. You can execute each script from the command line using the `python` command followed by the script's filename.

```bash
python 0-print_list_integer.py
